# Description

- this is a working application which allows users to login and to register

# Tier One Features to Add

## Frontend

- Separate the register/login from the home page, each into its own page. So when you're done, should have a
  login page and a register page, with links to them in your header. Remember to add your routes for each page component

- The app has pretty much no styling. Use your creativity and knowledge of CSS to fix this!

The rest of these features require work on all parts of the stack (front, api-layer and data-layer).

## authenticated and non authenticated users

- a user should be able to view all the businesses
  - each business should have a name
- a user should be able to see the other users
- a review should have both a user_id and a business_id as well as:
  - a comment
  - a rating which is an integer from 1 to 5
- a user should be able to see the reviews made by a selected user with a link to /users/:id which they can be accessed from the users listing
- a user should be able to see the reviews of a selected business with a link to /businesses/:id which can be accessed from the businesses listing

## authenticated users

- a loggedin user should be able to create a review for a business
- a loggedin user should be able to remove a view which they created

- the wireframes provide a visual representation of the functionality which is described
